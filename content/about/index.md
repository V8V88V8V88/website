Hey Visitor! I am Vaibhav Pratap Singh, Welcome to my personal website :) I go by the Username > V8V88V8V88 / V8 on Internet. I am interested in Computers, Internet, FOSS, Linux, Design, Coding. I am currently a CSE student who loves to explore and learn about new areas of interest. I am curious by nature and I strongly believe in the KISS and Unix Philosophy. You are always welcome to ping me at my social handles, although I might respond them late :P
